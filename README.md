# User Database Management Project

# Overview

This project aims to manage user data through a web interface using state
management for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

# Features

- Add User: Functionality to add new users to the database.
- Delete User: Capability to remove existing users from the database.
- Edit User: Ability to modify details of existing users.
- Fetch User Details: Retrieve and display user information from the database.

# Technologies Used Frontend:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js for state management)

# Usage Adding a User:

- Navigate to the "Add User" section. Fill in the required details and submit
  the form.

# Deleting a User:

- Navigate to the user list. Click on the delete icon next to the user you wish
  to remove.

# Editing User Details:

- Navigate to the user list. Click on the edit icon next to the user whose
  details you want to modify. Fill in the updated details in the edit form and
  submit.

# Fetching User Details:

User details are fetched and displayed dynamically using React state management.

# Challenges Faced

- The primary challenge encountered during development was implementing the edit
  form functionality seamlessly within the React state management system.
  Ensuring that state updates were reflected correctly in the UI and managing
  form submission effectively required careful handling of component lifecycles
  and state updates.
